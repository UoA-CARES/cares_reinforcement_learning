class SumTree(object):
    """
    A sum tree data structure for storing replay priorities.

    A sum tree is a complete binary tree whose leaves contain values called
    priorities. Internal nodes maintain the sum of the priorities of all leaf
    nodes in their subtree.

    For capacity = 4, the tree may look like this:

                +---+
                |2.5|
                +-+-+
                    |
            +-------+--------+
            |                |
        +-+-+            +-+-+
        |1.5|            |1.0|
        +-+-+            +-+-+
            |                |
        +----+----+      +----+----+
        |         |      |         |
    +-+-+     +-+-+  +-+-+     +-+-+
    |0.5|     |1.0|  |0.5|     |0.5|
    +---+     +---+  +---+     +---+

    This is stored in a list of numpy arrays:
    self.nodes = [ [2.5], [1.5, 1], [0.5, 1, 0.5, 0.5] ]

    For conciseness, we allocate arrays as powers of two, and pad the excess
    elements with zero values.

    This is similar to the usual array-based representation of a complete binary
    tree, but is a little more user-friendly.
